# NodeJSExperiment

www.[hostthefile].com (Need to figure out how to host backend)

This project is the first step into utilizing back-end and front-end coding for web development.  

In this experiemnt, I have use techniques such as EJS templates, embedded Javascript within the EJS files, static assets and simulated database information via additional JSON files. Many of the pages are using Reddit as a basis for content.

Tools used:

- NodeJS
- Express
- EJS file delivery system
- Bootstrap

Final styling still needs to be done.
